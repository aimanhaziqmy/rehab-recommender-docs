# Tutorial Intro

This API is currently in development and experiment phase. The API is used to provide personalisation for patients in doing cardiac rehabilitation. Currently, the machine learning techique used are Matrix Factorization. Other techniques such as Neural Collaborative Filtering, Expert-in-the-Loop, Two-Tower Optimisation and BQML are still in experiment.
The API aims to provide personalised recommendations for exercise plans tailored to each patient's condition and recovery progress.  By using advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques, the API can understand patients' descriptions of their symptoms and health issues to generate customised rehabilitation programs.

The personalized recommendations generated by the API help patients recover more effectively by optimizing their rehabilitation plans to suit their unique health conditions and fitness goals. The API continues to improve through experimentation with various machine learning models and algorithms to provide the most accurate and helpful recommendations for patients.
As the API matures, it will be integrated into healthcare systems and applications to offer an enhanced patient experience and improved health outcomes. The long-term vision is to develop an AI-based rehabilitation assistant that can understand patientsâ€™ needs, monitor their progress, and motivate them through their recovery journey.
